TITLE OF THE PROJECT 1 : HANGMAN GAME
Description of the game : The process is to give the plqyer 6 guesses to find a random word taken from a category of the game. The three categories
that we choose for the game are fruits, animals and countries.
When the game loads, the game asks the user to select an option between fruits, animals, and countries and generates a random word from the 
chosen option. The button letters appear and the user input section made of dashes also appear in order to let the player guess the word 
properly. After 6 guesses, the player loses the game a loss message is printed to the screen otherwise a win message is printed to the screen.
Finally we propose to the player to play a new game by clicking the button new game.
One important functionality of our game is the use of canvas methods to draw the initial frame an a man during the process of guessing the word in the 
case the player has not clicked the right button letter.
